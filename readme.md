/* Notes */

// All <div> elements with class="tabcontent" are hidden by default (with CSS and JS). When a user clicks on a button - it will open the tab content that "matches" this button.
// Create 5 buttons that act as tabs. All of them have an onClick handler

// used toggle function on my name on the home page which toggles between hide and show for the selected elements

// on my bio page i appended a button to the button left section. when the button is clicked, the photo of my pet will show and it will appear in 2000 milliseconds.  

//for my resume I used jquery show function to show the section 

// Carousel
// Added event listener/handler onto my 'next' and 'previous' button
// Length gives us the count on how long the array is, so subtracting 1 because array count starts at 0

// The :first-of-type selector in CSS allows you to target the first occurrence of an element within its container.
